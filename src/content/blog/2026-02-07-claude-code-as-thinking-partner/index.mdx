The most value I get from Claude Code isn't writing code -- it's as an inexhaustible thinking partner. I spent a few hours the other day coming up with a comprehensive plan for database schema and state management and migration during which time I didn't write a single line of code. To hold the entire problem in your head is challenging, and Claude Code helped me to avoid information overload, by condensing information for me in a way I could engage with socratically.

I came out of that deep think with a really comprehensive understanding of the problem I was solving, having gone through a few iterations of spotting errors in my thinking.

The result of this "unproductive" segment of my day, was to realise that we didn't need to write much code to solve this problem, we just needed to develop a clear understanding of how each component managed its schema and state, and that the very thing I originally intended was something that the system should manage at runtime.

If you looked from the outside at this half day you might call it inactivity. The reality is, I just saved a load of redundant and confused code from entering the project, and solved the problem at the same time.

You don't just have to use Claude Code to code.
