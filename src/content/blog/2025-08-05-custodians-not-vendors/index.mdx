We never host our clients' infrastructure or systems on their behalf. Especially when working with startups, it's doubly important that there's no lock-in from their suppliers or lack of autonomy over their tech. I've heard enough horror stories. We don't do long contract notice periods either - we're confident in the value we provide and embrace the uncertainty of the startup journey. That's our philosophy as founding engineers.

Whatever the system - Slack, GitHub, AWS, 1Password, GSuite. We build strong, independent tech companies - they need the infrastructure, and they need all the keys to run it in house - with in-house engineers.

If they need systems or infrastructure they don't have, we help set them up with their consent, in their name, with their payment details, and share credentials securely with a password manager.

We're the custodians of these systems, not the vendors.
