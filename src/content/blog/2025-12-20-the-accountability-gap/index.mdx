Why haven't AI tools taken over the world yet? It's because people still have a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of many jobs. In many cases people aren't just paying for a service, they're paying for someone else to be (partially) accountable. They want the feeling of comfort that someone else has thought deeply about something. AI removes that accountability chain, leaving the paying person holding the bag with no-one else to point to. *That's* the hidden value that everyone misses.

Think about it from a consulting perspective. When a startup hires experienced engineers, they're not just buying code. They're buying the peace of mind that someone with battle scars has thought deeply about their architecture, their failure modes, their scaling strategy. If they generate their entire stack with AI, they're the only ones accountable when something goes wrong at 2am. Nobody to call. Nobody who can say "we considered that edge case." The output might look the same, but the accountability is gone.
