description: "When to transition from a vibe-coded MVP to production software. The answer is a function of risk."

When do you jump from a vibe-coded product to production software? And why?

Let's imagine a very realistic and now common scenario - a non technical business owner boots up Lovable, and vibes out a platform for their customers to use. When do you need to put real scaffolding under this thing?

- Before you get customers on it?
- When you have traction?
- When you hire a dev?
- Never?

There's not really a conclusive right answer (although if you chose "never", then the product probably isn't going to amount to much over time). Bear in mind that setting up a full professional software engineering environment and infrastructure is a bit beyond what you'd expect of the average developer, who will be much more specialised.

My take: the answer is a function of risk.

Your vibe coded MVP is a tool for de-risking the market. You're using it to answer the question: "Does anyone actually want this?" It's fast, cheap, and perfect for that job.

The moment you get traction - real users who depend on your service, and especially paying customers - the nature of your biggest risk fundamentally changes.

It's no longer "Will they come?". It's "Can we keep the lights on?". That's the inflection point. It's the moment your MVP stops being an asset (a tool for learning) and starts becoming a liability (a ceiling on your growth). It's when you can't build the feature your biggest customer is demanding, or when the platform's limitations start causing churn.

So for me, the answer is closest to "when you have traction". But not as a vanity metric. It's when the operational risk and the opportunity cost of not building properly begin to outweigh the cost of doing so.

Build before that, and you're prematurely optimising a product nobody wants. Wait too long, and you're trying to rebuild a soapbox into a Ferrari while doing 100mph on the motorway.
