description: "Two broke PhD students decided to start a company. A decade later we're still at it."

It was 10 years ago this Saturday when Francis and I, being broke PhD students, decided to start a company together to get a bit of extra income on the side. We found our first client through the University, and did (I hope) such a good job that they decided to invest a bit of cash to get us started.

It never really crossed my mind that a decade later we'd still be at it as ExaDev, having worked with high tech startups, big consultancies, government departments and multinationals, and having a team across the UK and Germany.

This week, with the slight wrinkle of a poorly timed COVID outbreak, we got almost everyone together in Anglesey where it started. A little surprise for us was this cake, with a now borderline meme picture of the two of us in our first office.

I don't think my hair's got any better, but we definitely have.

A massive thank you to all of our team. To a person, you are the best kind of laid back professionals and we're so lucky to have you all.

Here's to another 10.
