      <p>
        I'm Will. I'm an engineer first, CEO second. I co-founded
        <a href="https://exadev.io">ExaDev</a> in 2013 with Francis Williams while we were both doing our PhDs at Bangor.
        We started in a bedroom with nothing but laptops and stubbornness, and grew it into a 17-strong technical
        accelerator, Google supplier, and serial startup practice operating across the UK, US, Australia and Germany.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExaDev builds companies, not just software. We embed small, senior engineering teams directly into early-stage
        startups, acting as fractional CTOs, tech leads, and hands-on builders. No management overhead, no tech-adjacent
        roles. Engineers are the decision makers. Through our investment arm
        <a href="https://exacap.io">ExaCap</a>, we take equity stakes to align our incentives with our clients' long-term
        success. The startups we've worked with have collectively raised over &pound;77m.
      </p>

      <p>
        I completed my PhD in Unsupervised Change Detection part-time over seven years while building the business.
        That experience taught me the value of quiet diligence over loud promises. Along the way I've worked as
        a developer, infrastructure engineer, data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, and tech lead.
        I still can't make my mind up which I like most.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early days we built robotics control software for medical labs, patient record systems for the NHS, and
        I taught computer science at Bangor University on the side. More recently I've led data science and engineering
        at HMRC at petabyte scale, contributed to Google Labs, and worked on Sky's identity platform serving millions of
        concurrent connections. The common thread is that I like hard problems and I like building things that matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also organise the tech community in Lancaster through
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/software-lancaster/">Software Lancaster</a> and
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/software-lancaster-talks/">Software Lancaster Talks</a>,
        which ExaDev sponsors.
